# WhatsApp LocalAuth Implementation - Summary

## ✅ Completed Changes

### 1. LocalAuth Configuration with Custom Session Directory
**File:** `server/services/whatsappService.js`

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ Configured `LocalAuth` with custom `dataPath` pointing to `wwebjs_auth` folder
- ✅ Session directory: `f:\TJP\mushroom-website\wwebjs_auth`
- ✅ Headless mode: `true` (already enabled)

### 2. Session Persistence

## 🔍 Notes Unlock & Sales Credit Logic

**Status:** The user mentioned restoring "Notes unlock and Sales Credit logic" from VS Code Timeline.

### Current Implementation:
- **Sales Credit Logic:** ✅ Already implemented in `/api/sales` endpoint (lines 245-310)
  - Automatic payment status based on payment type
  - Credit sales marked as "Unpaid"
  - Settlement endpoint available

### Potential Missing Logic:
The user might be referring to:
1. **Morning routine for unlocking notes/observations** - Not found in current code
2. **Specific morning credit report** - Not found in current code

## 🎯 Next Steps Required

### User Action Needed:
Please check VS Code Timeline and restore the following if they were present:

1. **Notes Unlock Logic:**
   - Was there a morning cron job to unlock/reset daily notes?
   - Was there a specific endpoint for notes management?

2. **Morning Sales Credit Logic:**
   - Was there a morning report for pending credits?
   - Was there a daily summary WhatsApp message?

### To Check Timeline:
1. Open `server/index.js` in VS Code
2. Right-click → "Open Timeline"
3. Look for commits around the time when morning logic was working
4. Compare with current version to identify missing code

## 🚀 How to Test WhatsApp LocalAuth

1. **First Time Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   node index.js
   ```
   - QR code will appear in terminal
   - Scan with WhatsApp → Linked Devices
   - Session saved to `wwebjs_auth` folder

2. **Subsequent Runs:**
   - Server will auto-connect using saved session
   - No QR code needed
   - Session persists even after PC restart

3. **Check WhatsApp Status:**
   - Visit: `https://juicy-valenka-tjp-mushroom-9ef17e36.koyeb.app/api/admin/whatsapp-status`
   - Status: `connected` = Ready
   - Status: `scan_needed` = QR code available

## 📁 Session Directory Structure
```
mushroom-website/
├── server/
│   ├── index.js
│   └── services/
│       └── whatsappService.js
└── wwebjs_auth/          ← New session folder
    └── session-*/        ← Auto-created by whatsapp-web.js
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Headless Mode:** Server runs in background, no browser window opens
2. **Session Backup:** Consider backing up `wwebjs_auth` folder periodically
3. **Re-authentication:** If session expires, delete `wwebjs_auth` folder and scan QR again
4. **Git Ignore:** Add `wwebjs_auth/` to `.gitignore` to avoid committing session data
